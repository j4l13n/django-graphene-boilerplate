# Django and GraphQL Boilerplate

I have been using Django and Graphene for a while now but I have always struggled to get started with simple configurations.

## Using Graphene Django Boilerplate

Using this repo only needs `python3` installed

### Run the main file to get a graphene django boiler plate

```
> $ git clone 
> $ cd django-graphene-boilerplate
> $ python3 main.py --name <name-of-your-project>

```

The above commands will generate django project and add configuration to accept graphene-django
